How to play the game (Software)
---

This is a full runthrough of how to fully upload/run all the correct code.
The four things you (and everyone else playing the game) needs to do is listed below.

**NOTE: I CANNOT GUARANTEE GAME IS NOT SUPPORTED ON MAC DUE TO THE USAGE OF WINDOWS FUNCTIONS**

## Download
* **On the top right of the screen, click the "Code" button, then download as zip.**
* **Then extract to a convenient place, such as your Desktop.**
## Arduino Code pt 1.

This part will be for the code that you need to install in your directories before being able to upload code.

* First, copy the folder called "Game" into the Arduino libraries folder.
  * This folder is located in **Users/Documents/Arduino/libraries**
## Arduino Code pt. 2

This part is the easiest, just open test.ino, inside of the folder **Arduino/test**, and upload test.ino. If you get errors, go back to Arduino pt1 and make sure everything is in the correct folder.

## C++ Program

This part will go over how to properly run the C++ Program.

* Open CLion
* Click File>Open
* Select the folder called "C++ Program" (**not** any individual files) and open it.
* Once the folder opens in CLion, double click the file CMakeLists.txt
*

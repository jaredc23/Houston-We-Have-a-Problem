# The file Test_Program.ino is to make sure all the Arduino is functioning properly. 
This program just tests the Arduino, not the C++ program, so there is no need to start the C++ program for this, just upload to the Arduino and use the functions listed below:
Here is what you should expect:
---
* When you press any buttons, all of the lights should toggle on and off. 
* If you move the potentiometer, the servo should move as well

This will make sure that all of the buttons, lights, potentiometer, and servo are hooked up and working properly.

If what is expected did not happen, it is possible there is a wiring error.

When you are done:
---
Follow the instruction manual to upload the correct code to play the game. This program is just to test, so once everything is working properly, then continue to do the game as normal.
